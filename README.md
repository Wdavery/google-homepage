## TOP Project 1: Google Homepage

This is my first project for The Odin Project.
I was required to visually emulate the Google homepage as best as possible. 

Some pain points:
- Getting things placed properly vertically was frustrating. Especially the main search bar.
- Most of my time was spent trying different ways to get the content centered.
- Knowing when I should be putting content in a `<div>`, which was a lot more often than I initially did.

For next time:
- Definitely want to practice using Flexbox more because it was what I ultimately used for alignment of things, but some bits felt a bit hacky. Would definitely start with it in mind next time.
- I might want to draw out a quick outline of how the sections will be nested before I start. It will likely change, but I found I was constantly adding and removing parents/children to do what I wanted. Need to think about that as I go.
