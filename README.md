## TOP Project 1: Google Homepage

This is my first project for The Odin Project.
I was required to visually emulate the Google homepage as best as possible.

First attempt looked good, but I was not happy with the code at all. I felt very hacky and I struggled getting elements aligned properly.

I then spent some time with Flexbox and came back to this project. With the extra familiarity I managed to clean it up quite a bit during the refactor; mostly removing unneeded `<div>` elements and classes. 
Thanks to (CSS Diner)[https://flukeout.github.io/], I remembered I could use `#id  A` to select children without needed to add a class to each one. That cleaned up a lot of code.
